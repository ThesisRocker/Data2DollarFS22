    "The following notebook uses the Meteomatics API (Weather Data Provider, normally not free of charge, but Yann Bregy works there and received the permission to use it for academic purposes). It retrieves data for all ZIP codes in Switzerland. We chose the 10-year average radiation per ZIP code and retrieved all data from April in a hourly interval. Although data from the whole year would be more accurate, it would have meant much more data points and hence more computationally intensive requests from the API, which timed out when we tried."
